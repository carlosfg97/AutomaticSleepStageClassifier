# Automatic Sleep Classification

This repository holds the code for training and testing a sleep classification model in Python. The techniques used are CNNs and LSTMs and the input data is the EEG channel of the dataset available [here](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/). 

The code supports a thesis project that is currently under review for publishing; therefore, currently I am not able to upload the entire paper. However, most of the important ideas and proposals are explained inside the notebooks.

The whole pipeline of the project, from data extraction, to modeling, to output analysis is available and adequatelly documented in the 3 notebooks, which are to be executed in the following order: 1. Data Acquisition --> 2. Classifiers --> 3. Threshold analysis.
